Responsive-Gridster
===================

Extending gridster.js to be responsive.

## Limitations
1. Random displacement of widgets.
2. Responsive features haven't been integrated into Gridster and are being kept separate (for now).
3. There are still some random glitches when viewing on mobile devices.
